<h2>1. Get Zig</h2><p>Zine has only one dependency: the Zig compiler.</p><p>We currently track Zig's master branch so you will need to get an unstable build  from <a href="https://ziglang.org">the official website</a>. In the future Zine will pin to a tagged release of Zig, be it an official release <a href="https://devlog.hexops.com/2024/announcing-nominated-zig/">or not</a>.</p><h2>2. Clone Zine's Sample Site</h2><p>After that, the easiest way of getting started is by cloing a sample website and start hacking on it.</p><p><i><strong><code>shell</code></strong></i></p><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/kristoff-it/zine-sample-site.git
$ cd zine-sample-website
$ zig build serve -Dport=8080
