<h2>About</h2><p>This guide assumes that you're already familiar with GitHub Pages. Please refer <a href="https://pages.github.com/">the official GitHub Pages documentation</a> for more info.</p><h2>1. Build locally</h2><p>The first one, which is more efficient, is to build the website locally and commit it to the correct branch/subdir.</p><p>Currently Zine doesn't offer any help automating this process, but in the future it might.</p><p><strong>NOTE: currently Zine doesn't clean <code>zig-out/</code> across rebuilds so you will have to it manually.</strong></p><h2>2. Use GitHub Actions</h2><p>This is a more popular, but slower option.</p><p>GitHub Actions runner have an inherent overhead and, since Zine is a collection of tools that gets compiled on-demand, your runner will need to do some work that wounldn't be necessary with a single-executable tool.</p><p>Luckly, the build can be cached by adding a few lines to your GitHub Actions workflow.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/kristoff-it/zine/actions">This site currently builds in 25-35 seconds</a>, of which 9 are spent setting up Zig, 2 restoring the Zine tools cache, and 1 for the actual site build.</p><p><i><strong><code>.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml</code></strong></i></p><pre><code>name: github pages
