<h2>About</h2><p>This guide assumes that you're already familiar with GitHub Pages. Please refer <a href="https://pages.github.com/">the official GitHub Pages documentation</a> for more info.</p><p>If you're a developer looking to deploy a static website to GitHub Pages, you have two main options.</p><h2>1. Build locally</h2><p>The first one, which is more efficient, is to build the website locally and commit it to the correct branch/subdir.</p><p>Currently Zine doesn't offer any help automating this process, but in the future it might.</p><h2>2. Use GitHub Actions</h2><p>This one is a more hands-off, but slower option.</p><p>It is inherently slower because of all the overhead introduced by GitHub Actions. Additionally, Zine is a collection of tools compiled on demand by your build script, which is a bad match for GitHub Actions given its ephemeral nature.</p><p>One day we might maintain a set of Zine actions that pre-builds Zine once for everybody but, in the meantime, the following workflow definition will use the GitHub's caching system to cache builds of Zine for you.</p><p><i><strong><code>.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml</code></strong></i></p><pre><code>name: github pages
